    <p><li><b>Step 1</b></li></p>
    <p>
        <br>In a large Dutch oven or other heavy, lidded pot, melt the butter over medium. Add leeks, season with salt and pepper and cook, 
        <br>stirring occasionally, until softened, 3 minutes. Add the garlic and miso and cook, stirring to mash the miso until well blended and caramelized, 2 minutes.</p>

        <p><li><b>Step 2</b></li></p>
        <p>
        <br>Add potatoes, clam juice and 3 cups of water. Season with salt and pepper and bring to a boil over medium-high, stirring to lift up any browned bits from the bottom of the pot.
        <br>Cover, decrease heat to medium-low and cook until potatoes are tender, about 15 minutes.</p>

        <p><li><b>Step 3</b></li></p>
        <p>
            Meanwhile, in a pot of boiling water, cook ramen noodles until al dente and drain well. Divide among 4 bowls.</p>
        
        <p><li><b>Step 4</b></li></p>
        <p>
            <br>Add shrimp, radishes and cream to the chowder and mix well. 
            <br>Cover and poach shrimp over low until just cooked through and pink, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in snap peas and ginger; season with salt and pepper.</p>

        <p><li><b>Step 5</b></li></p>
        <p>Ladle chowder on top of the noodles. Garnish with chives and serve warm, with hot sauce on the side if using.</p>

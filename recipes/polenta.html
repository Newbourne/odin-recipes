    <p><li><b>Step 1</b></li></p>
    <p>
        For firm polenta use 4 cups water; for soft polenta use 5 cups water. Bring water to a boil in a medium,
        heavy saucepan over high heat. <br> Add 1 teaspoon salt. Pour cornmeal slowly into water, stirring with a wire whisk or 
        wooden spoon. <br>Continue stirring as mixture thickens, 2 to 3 minutes.</p>
<p></p>
     <p><li><b>Step 2</b></li></p>
    <p>
        Turn heat to low. Cook for at least 45 minutes, stirring every 10 minutes or so. 
        <br>If polenta becomes quite thick, thin it with ½ cup water, stir well and continue cooking. 
        <br>Add up to 1 cup more water as necessary, to keep polenta soft enough to stir. 
        <br>Put a spoonful on a plate, let it cool, then taste. 
        <br>Grains should be swollen and taste cooked, not raw. Adjust salt and add pepper if you wish.</p>

        <p><li><b>Step 3</b></li></p>
        <p>
            <br>For firm polenta, lightly butter a baking sheet or shallow dish, approximately 8½ by 11 inches. 
            <br>Carefully pour polenta into pan. Using a spatula, spread polenta to a thickness of ¾ inch. 
            <br>Cool to room temperature to allow polenta to solidify. Cover and refrigerate for up to 3 days. 
            <br>For soft polenta, add 6 tablespoons butter to pot and stir well. Serve immediately or transfer to a double boiler set over low heat, cover and keep warm for up to an hour or so. 
            <br>(Or set the saucepan in a pot of barely simmering water.) 
            Stir well before spooning into low soup bowls. Sprinkle with Parmesan, if desired.</p>
